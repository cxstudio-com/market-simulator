Version 1.0 Simulator
The simulator runs to completion on the historical data. The simulation works with simple "below average" buying strategy and 
3% profit selling strategy.

Issues:
1. Trade evaluators don't model market trends well.
2. Single Buy/sell strategy is not sufficient to model various real world strategies. needs to take in multiple strategy models
